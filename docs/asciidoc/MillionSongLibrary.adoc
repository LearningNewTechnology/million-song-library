One does not simply build a rich, dynamic library with a million songs. It takes an array of microservices crafted with open technologies, a database that won't hold back performance, and an architecture that's ready to venture out to the cloud when you are.

TIP: With this demonstration project, you can deploy a Million Song Library and see what it's like to launch a microservices-based application of your own. If you have questions about the demo, feel free to drop us a line at support_msl@kenzan.com.
