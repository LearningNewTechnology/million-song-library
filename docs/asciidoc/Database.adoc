= Database Architecture

:blank: pass:[ +]

Due to the large amount of data to be persisted, and the need for quick reads and linear scalable performance, the Million Song Library project uses Cassandra as the back-end datastore, along with the Datastax Java driver as the interface.

== Design

We used the http://kdm.dataview.org[Kashlev Data Modeler^] (KDM) to model the Cassandra schema. 

=== Entity-Relationship Model

Initially, we performed a traditional data analysis -- looking at what entities are required based on the use cases, and what the relationships are between those entities. The result is illustrated in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model[entity-relationship model^] below which was created with KDM and uses Chen's notation.

endif::[]

=== Access Patterns

Next, we used those same use cases to determine how the data in the entities would be accessed. Given the use patterns of a Cassandra datastore, it's important to think in terms of queries when designing the schema. This can be a challenging transition for those accustomed to building SQL schemas. Maybe even more challenging is the need to denormalize the schema -- a thought that could keep an SQL database designer up at night. Luckily, there are many good tutorials and documents online dicussing this process.

== Implementation

The following table shows the details for each query included in the access patterns diagram above.

NOTE: Fields marked with *K* are partition keys. Fields marked with *C* are cluster keys.

== Data Import

The Million Song Library project uses data from the http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset[Million Song Dataset^]. (A 10,000 song subset of the full data set is also available.) Downloading the data set yields a gzipped file that contains two directories: *AdditionalFiles* and *data*. The *data* directory has a number of subdirectories that contain an *HDF* file (with the extension *h5*) for each song in the data set. The *AdditionalFiles* directory contains several files that summarize the data set -- these files are not used for the import.

HDF or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format[Hierarchical Data Format^] files contain all the data needed for albums, artists, and songs. We use the Python library written by mailto:tb2332@columbia.edu[Thierry Bertin-Mahieux] to read these files. (We initially tried using Java and https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/JNI/jhi5/[JHI5^] but ran into issues with the native library aspect of that implementation.)

At a high level, the data import process uses Python to traverse a given directory tree, consuming all of the *.h5* files and creating a single CSV file with one line for each song. This CSV file is then consumed by a Java program to create the CSVs that are inserted into the Cassandra cluster.

NOTE: The tags within an *.h5* file (*/metadata/artist_terms*) essentially indicate the genre of the song. There are so many genres used in the data set that it makes them not particularly useful as a searching mechanism. For this reason, a list of genres is defined in *Genre.java* to declare which of the genres we are interested in persisting. Any genres not found in the list are ignored.
